### <b>Guide to Successful Cases for Domestic Abuse Victims -
Timelines, Types of Abuse, Evidence, Witnesses, Aid, & Technology</b>

Despite the growing awareness of domestic abuse and the social recognition for abuse victims, this support is harder to gain through court systems and legal routes. In the aftermath of an abusive relationship, the risk of harassment and further abuse from the abuser can remain high especially because they already gained access to the victim’s network and information. In addition to physical assault, verbal abuse and psychological damage can also pose a large risk to the victim’s ability to recover their life after the relationship.

This guide addresses how a person can look out for possible risks during and after an abusive relationship as well as to create a court case that can be both defensible and convincing. This process begins with creating a clear timeline for documenting the events and impact of abuse, and emphasizes being mindful of how technology can be used for help. 

<b><i>Keep in mind that any legal advice or legislative knowledge in the guide is very broad, and it can be helpful to look up laws specific to your state or general region.</b></i>

### Timeline
#### What is a Timeline
Being able to identify domestic abuse is being able to create a timeline identifying how abuse has affected the victim’s trajectory. To start a legal case for domestic abuse, the victim needs to have a clear account of how involvement with an abuser has shifted the victim’s social network, the decisions they make, and their attitude towards the world.

The timeline is the collection of injuries, witnesses, communication, and documents that create the complete narrative of how the abusive relationship has affected the victim’s life. Prior to the relationship, people and evidence can prove the victim’s character and their values. During the relationship, documents and messages can prove the destructive influence that the abuser has had on the victim’s life. After the relationship, any communication and witnesses can prove the continued threat and impact that the abuser still has on the victim.

### Stages of the Timeline
Prior to the abusive relationship, the victim can illustrate their character through character witnesses. There may be school friends, acquaintances that have since lost touch, and family members. Character witnesses like these can testify on the victim’s personality, any good deeds they have done, and their general reputation. When there is a longer span of time for the mutual relationship, there’s also more credibility given to their testimony and knowledge of you.
<br>During the abusive relationship, the victim could be introduced to new people, actively seeking out specific people, or reducing their contact with their older acquaintances. While the very basis of domestic abuse is to cause harm within a very intimate relationship, being able to log and label the corresponding times of when ‘outsiders’ were present can be incredibly helpful for verifying the context surrounding a particular dispute. When this is compared with any testimony from prior to the relationship, witnesses can prove that a victim has shifted their personality or actions in a way that they wouldn't have acted by themselves. 

In the aftermath of an abusive relationship, it remains important to maintain a timeline of various relationships because of the possibility of continued abuse. If the abuser continues to harass the victim, any records of this harassment would have to be documented through close witnesses and preserved electronic evidence. Besides providing screenshots or documents, close friends and family members can give better details about the emotional impact and the destabilizing effect that harassment created in the victim’s life.

Throughout this entire timeline, the abusive relationship stands at the center while each relationship and event can be considered as ripple effects. Besides a general summary of any assault and harassment, the most important point is to link various testimonies and all documented evidence to significant points of abuse and harassment. By structuring a timeline with many details, abuse in an intimate relationship can still be validated and proven. 

### What is “Domestic Abuse”
